YSLD Extension
==============
This plugin adds support for the YSLD styling language.

`YSLD <https://github.com/geotools/geotools/blob/master/modules/unsupported/ysld/README.md>`_ is a YAML based language which closely matches the stucture of SLD, and the internal data model that GeoServer's renderer uses.  For details on YSLD syntax, see the GeoTools documentation.
